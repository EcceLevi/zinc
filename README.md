# zinc
Web-server reconnaissance platform (currently - set of tools) with dynamic web-interface to automate many tasks, represent data and store your projects.
Developed mainly for bughunting(-er) needs, but future updates *may* include more advanced functions and can be used during pentest (well, after I learn more of python, of course).

__version: zinc-0.1__ - initial
